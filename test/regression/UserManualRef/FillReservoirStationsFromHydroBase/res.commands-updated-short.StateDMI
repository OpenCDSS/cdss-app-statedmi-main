# Creates the reservoir station file for the Upper Colorado River monthly models
# Initial reservoir contents are set to 9/1908 estimated contents
#
# Phase IIIb modifications
#	to reflect reservoir storage as of October 1908 - zero out account owners' current
#	storage capacity if the reservoir came on-line during the study period.
#	No changes made to reservoirs that were on-line in 10/1908 (including aggregate storage).
#
#	Turned on Wolford Mountain and added Wolford Mountain accounts and storage rights per CWCB
#
#       Eliminated Unallocated Pool from Vega Reservoir; it was getting filled but not booked over
#       to the Power Exchange pool, and could not get released for use
#
# commands used in this file establish reservoir capacity, fill date,
# reservoir account ownership, area-capacity tables and representative
# evaporation stations (see StateMod documentation)
#
#
#  Step 1 - read reservoirs from network file and sort alphabetically
#
ReadReservoirStationsFromNetwork(InputFile="..\network\cm2005.net")
SortReservoirStations(Order=Ascending)
#
#  Step 2 - read reservoir information from HydroBase
#
FillReservoirStationsFromHydroBase(ID="*")
#
#  Step 3 - set reservoir information not available in HydroBase including min/max
#           content, starting content, and account information
