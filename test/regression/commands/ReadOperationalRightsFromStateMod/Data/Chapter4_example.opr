#
# The following changes were made to the original example file on 2010-12-13 to make it compliant with
# the StateMod documentation and allow automated testing to compare input and output:
#
# * Type 8 second intervening structure was shifted to the left one character
# * Added type 10 examples with OprLimit = 1 and 2
# * Type 12 name was shifted to the left one character (smashes into ID but aligns with format)
# * Type 16 change identifier from .01 to .02 so as to not interfere with the type 14 right that had the same ID
# * Type 16 change dumx from 1. to 0. - no intervening structures are provided in this example
# * Type 20 cut name from 25 to 24 characters (drop last character)
# * Type 20 card 2 shift to right so that format adheres to documentation
# * Type 21 shift admin number to right by 1 to adhere to format
# * Type 22 shift admin number to right by 1 to adhere to format
