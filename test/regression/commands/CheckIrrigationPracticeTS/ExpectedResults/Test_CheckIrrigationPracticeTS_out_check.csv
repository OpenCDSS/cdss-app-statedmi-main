# Commands: 
# # Test checking irrigation practice time series data where some values are in error
# # The set command won't let invalid data be set from parameters so use
# # values in a StateCU input file to trigger the check warnings.
# # Compare the data csv to make sure the data are being produced as expected
# # and the check file csv to make sure the checks are working.
# # The expected status is Warning because the check will detect the missing values.
