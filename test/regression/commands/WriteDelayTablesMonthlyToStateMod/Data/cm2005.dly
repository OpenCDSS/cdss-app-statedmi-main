# Return flow delay table developed by LRE January, 2003
# Based on general analyses documented in LRE Delay Pattern Memorandum, 1/2003
#
# Adjusted by San Juan team to include incidental losses in types 1, 2, and 8 is USBR recomd. 7/2003 ra
# Pattern 1 is previous Pattern 1 at incidental loss rate of 3% occuring in first month
# Pattern 2 is previous Pattern 2 at incidental loss rate of 3% occuring in first month
# Pattern 3 is not used
# Pattern 4 is immediate returns, used for M&I and Hydropower diverisons
# Pattern 5 is used to represent snow-making return flows
# Pattern 6 is previous Pattern 1
# Pattern 7 is previous Pattern 2
#
# Note - the next note refers to the previous patterns
#
# Note - only return flow pattern 1 and 2 have been replaced below.  Return Flow
#        pattern 1 should be used for lands irrigated relatively close to a live
#        stream or drain (<1200 feet).  Return Flow patter 2 should be used for lands
#        irrigating further from a live stream (>1200 feet).  Pattern 3 is not used
#        in the western slope models.  Pattern 4 is immediate return used for municipal
#        and industrial diversions.  Pattern 5 is not used in the western slope models.
