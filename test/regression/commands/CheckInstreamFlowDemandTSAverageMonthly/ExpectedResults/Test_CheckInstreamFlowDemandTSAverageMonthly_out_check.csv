# Commands: 
# # Test checking instream flow demand time series (average monthly) data
# # The set command won't let invalid data be set from parameters so read bad data
# # to trigger the check warnings.
# # Compare the data date value file to make sure the data are being produced as expected
# # and the check file csv to make sure the checks are working.
# # The expected status is Warning because the check will detect the missing values.
