# Command file name: "C:\Develop\StateDMI_SourceBuild\StateDMI\test\regression\commands\CheckDiversionStations\Test_CheckDiversionStations.StateDMI"
# Commands: 
# # Test check diversion station data where each checked value is in error
# # The set command won't let invalid data be set from parameters so use
# # missing values to trigger the check warnings.
# # Compare the data csv to make sure the data are being produced as expected
# # and the check file csv to make sure the checks are working.
# # The expected status is Warning because the check will detect the missing values.
