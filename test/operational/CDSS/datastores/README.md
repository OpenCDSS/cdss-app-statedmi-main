# datastores #

This folder contains datastore configuration files for the development environment
that mimic the operational environment.  These files may need to be better handled
with `.gitignore` if multiple developers need their own configurations,
perhaps by using the developer user name in the filename.

Similar files exist in `resources/runtime/datastores`, which are distributed with the software.
