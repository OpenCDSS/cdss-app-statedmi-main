# # Simple example to define two CU locations and write files.
# # First read a couple of CU locations from a delimited (list) file.
# ReadCULocationsFromList(ListFile="culoc.csv",IDCol=1,NameCol=2)
# # Fill the CU location information from HydroBase and then assign
# # climate station data.
# FillCULocationsFromHydroBase(ID="*")
# # Assign climate station data.
# SetClimateStation(ID="station1",Name="Station 1",Latitude=44,Elevation=5500,Region1="County1",IfNotFound=Add)
# SetClimateStation(ID="station2",Name="Station 2",Latitude=44,Elevation=5502,Region1="County2",IfNotFound=Add)
# SetCULocationClimateStationWeights(ID="*",Weights="station1,.2,.3;station2,.8,.7")
# # Write as list and StateCU files, to illustrate output formats.
# WriteCULocationsToStateCU(OutputFile="example-out.str")
# WriteCULocationsToList(OutputFile="example-out.csv")
