ToDo items for StateDMI

[2010-02-18, Rick Parsons, minor bug, has workaround]
Fix bug in FillRiverNetworkFromHydroBase() where an ID matches a station (e.g., 3500 when
it is actually not a station - in this case a climate station).  The RIN object needs
a "hint" indicating the node type, so the proper HydroBase data can be usd.
