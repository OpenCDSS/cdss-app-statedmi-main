#> The StateMod XML network file is a generalized representation
#> of the StateMod network.  It includes some of the information
#> in the StateMod river network file (*.rin) but also includes
#> spatial layout information needed to produce a diagram of the
#> network.  The XML includes top-level properties for the
#> network, and data elements for each node in the network.
#> Each network node is represented as a single XML element
#> Node properties are stored as property = "value".
#> 
#> Node connections are specified by either a 
#>      <DownstreamNode ID = "Node ID"/> 
#> or
#>      <UpstreamNode ID = "Node ID"/>
#> tag.  There may be more than one upstream node, but at most 
#> one downstream node.
#> 
#> The XML network is typically created in one of three ways:
#> 
#> 1) An old "makenet" (*.net) file is read and converted to 
#> XML (e.g., in StateDMI).  In this case, some internal
#> identifiers (e.g., for confluence nodes) will be defaulted in
#> order to have unique identifiers, and the coordinates will be
#> those from the Makenet file, in order to preserve the diagram
#> appearance from in the original Makenet file.
#> 
#> 2) A StateMod river network file (*.rin) file is converted to
#> XML (e.g., by StateDMI).  In this case, confluence nodes will
#> not be present and StateDMI can be used to set the coordinates
#> to actual physical coordinates (e.g., UTM).  The coordinates
#> in the diagram will need to be repositioned to match a
#> straight-line representation, if such a representation is
#> desired.
#> 
#> 3) A new network is created entirely within the StateDMI or
#> StateModGUI interface.  In this case, the positioning of nodes
#> can occur as each node is defined in the network, or can occur
#> at the end.
#> 
#> Once a generalized XML network is available, StateDMI can be
#> used to create StateMod station files.  The node type and the
#> "IsNaturalFlow" property are used to determine lists of
#> stations for various files.
#> 
#> The following properties are used in this file.  Elements are
#> indicated in <angle brackets> with element properties listed
#> below each element.
#> 
#> NOTE:
#> 
#> If any of the following have an ampersand (&), greater than (>)
#> or less than (<) in them, these values MUST be escaped (see
#> below):
#>    - Page Layout ID
#>    - Node ID
#>    - Downstream Node ID
#>    - Upstream Node ID
#>    - Link Upstream Node ID
#>    - Link Downstream Node ID
#>    - Annotation Text
#> 
#> The escape values are the following.  These are automatically 
#> inserted by the network-saving software, if the characters are
#> inserted when editing a network programmatically, but if the 
#> network is edited by hand they must be inserted manually.

#>                        order to support printing on various

#>                        in the StateMod files.  It is assumed

#> 
#>       IsNaturalFlow    If "true", then the node is a location
#>                        where stream flows will be estimated
#>                        (and a station will be listed in the
#>                        StateMod stream estimate station file).

#>                        represent transbasin diversions.  This
#>                        property is only used to indicate how
