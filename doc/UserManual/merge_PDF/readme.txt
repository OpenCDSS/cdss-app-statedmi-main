PDF User Manuals are created by merging separate PDF documents.

- As of StateDMI 4.05.00, use the PDFTool for merging, which is a Java tool developed by OWF.
  This uses the UserManual_FileList.txt file.

- Legacy:  A table of contents is automatically inserted.  If this throws off the
  page count, insert 00_BlankPage.pdf after the 01_Cover*.pdf file in the merge list.
